    "This launch file runs our Cartesian control framework *CartesI/O* for the Reem-C robot. Its main component is the *ROS Cartesian Server*, which loads and runs the solver, and also exposes its complete API to ROS. Moreover, a *Marker Spawner* node is also executed in order to provide easy reference generation through RviZ markers. Finally, a standard *joint_state_publisher* is useful to control a postural task, if present. \n",
