    "------------------------------------\n",
    "First we decide which tasks we want to solve and which priorities, for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "stack:\n",
    "    - [\"LFoot\",\"RFoot\",\"HeadPostural\"]\n",
    "    - [\"CoMXY\",\"WaistYaw\"]\n",
    "    - [\"LArm\",\"RArm\"]\n",
    "    - [\"BodyPostural\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "here we have at the first level: ```LFoot```,```RFoot``` and ```HeadPostural``` which are all at the same first priority. The first two are full 6DoFs Cartesian tasks while the latter in a postural task to move the joints of the head. At second priority there are ```CoMXY``` and ```WaistYaw```; in this case we are interested to control 2 Cartesian directions for the CoM task and only the Yaw rotation for the Waist. Third priority we have both arms, 6DoFs Cartesian tasks and finally, last priority a postural. \n",
    "For what concern constraints, we want to consider joint limits and joint velocity limits, this can be done as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "constraints: [\"JointLimits\", \"VelocityLimits\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "in particular, these constraints will act to all the levels of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have to specify each task, for example the ```LFoot``` will be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "LFoot:\n",
    "    type: \"Cartesian\"\n",
    "    distal_link: \"left_sole_link\"\n",
    "    base_link: \"world\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "in this way we specify that ```LFoot``` is a full 6DoFs ```Cartesian``` task defined between ```world``` frame and ```left_sole_link```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task on the ```CoMXY``` will be defined as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "CoMXY:\n",
    "    type: \"Com\"\n",
    "    lambda: 0.1\n",
    "    indices: [0,1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "notice that the CoM is always specified in ```world``` frame. ```lambda``` is a a gain related to the position feedback of the task and ```indices``` is used to specify that only the X and Y directions (```0``` and ```1```) are controlled. Similarly for the ```WaistYaw``` we will have:\n",
