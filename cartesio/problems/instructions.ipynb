    "    - [\"LFoot\",\"RFoot\",\"Head\"]\n",
    "    - [\"CoMXY\",\"WaistYaw\"]\n",

    "here we have at the first level: ```LFoot```,```RFoot``` and ```Head``` which are all at the same first priority. The first two are full 6DoFs Cartesian tasks while the latter in a postural task to move the joints of the head. At second priority there are ```CoMXY``` and ```WaistYaw```; in this case we are interested to control 2 Cartesian directions for the CoM task and only the Yaw rotation for the Waist. Third priority we have both arms, 6DoFs Cartesian tasks and finally, last priority a postural. \n",
    "For what concern constraints, we want to consider joint limits and joint velocity limits, this can be done as:\n",

    "constraints: [\"JointLimits\", \"VelocityLimits\"]\n",

    "in particular, these constraints will acts to all the levels of the stack."
